<h3>Function overview</h3>

A millitome is a device designed to hold a freshly procured organ and facilitate cutting it into many small tissue blocks for usage in single cell analysis. A millitome has discrete, equally placed cutting grooves in both the x and y directions to guide a carbon steel cutting knife. The millitome is used to produce uniformly sized slices or cubes of tissue material that can be registered to organs from the CCF 3D Reference Object Library.

Millitome Generator uses modified 3D-models from the HuBMAP organ repository to generate 3D-printable millitomes, delivered as STL files. The exact shape, proportions and dimensions of the generated millitome depend directly on the properties of the organ model used.
