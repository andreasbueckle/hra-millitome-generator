<h3>V10</h3>

Version 10 is the first fully working version of Openscad code to produce millitome STL files. Through configuration variables at the top of the code, it can cover a wide variety of organ types, sizes and millitome layouts.

<h4>images</h4>
This folder contains images used for documentation. Not required for proper operation of Millitome Generato V10.

<h4>organ</h4>
Contains 24 files in STL format used by Millitome Generator V10 to cut the correct mold shapes. 

<h3>V11</h3>

Version 11 is based on the same millitome creation engine as version 10. While it can still be used as a standalone application running in Openscad it can now be launched from the computer's Terminal application, and be configured from the command line. A bash script allows to output many differently configured millitomes, properly named, in one signle operation. In addition it will also create lookup files in CSV format.
